# Real-Time-Crypto-Price-Tracking

A responsive crypto tracking web app that displays real-time(simulated) data of top cryptocurrencies, similar to CoinMarketCap.
Built using React and Redux Toolkit, this app presents important stats like price,marketcap, supply, and volume with a clean tabular UI.

# Key Features

1. Real-time (simulated)crypto price updates using setInterval (mimicking WebSpcket behavior).

2. Redux Toolkit for complete state management.

3. CSS for modern,responsive UI.

4. Color-coded price change indicators(green for gain, red for loss).

5. 7-day chart preview placeholder(similar to real dashboards).


# Tech Stack

1. Frontend : React.js.

2. State Management : Redux Toolkit.

3. Styling : CSS

4. Mock Data : Simulated using local JSON & javascript logic


# Sample Output
